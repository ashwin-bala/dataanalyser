Here are the system requirements for the project focusing on the ArtWorks data Art Institute of Chicago Museum:

Data Retrieval and Storage:
The system must be able to retrieve data from the Art Institute of Chicago’s APIs.
Retrieved data must be stored in the relational database. It should leverage the museum’s public data through their REST APIs. This must be standalone process on its own.

Data Analysis: 
The system must provide REST apis to perform analysis on the data in relational database.
This must be standalone process on its own.

User Experience:
Design a website with user-friendly interface for developers to interact with the Artwork data. 
Website UI must be independent from data collection and analysis processes.

Asynchronous Processing:
The system must leverage message queues for systems to communicate without being directly dependent on each other.

Artwork Attributes:
The system must handle various artwork attributes, including:
title, main_reference_number, date_display, date_start, date_end, place_of_origin, description, inscriptions, publication_history, exhibition_history, provenance_text, artwork_type_title, artwork_type_id, gallery_title, gallery_id, department_title, department_id, artist_id, artist_title, style_id, style_title, classification_id, classification_title, material_id, image_id, source_updated_at, updated_at, timestampstr

System must be able handle attributes nulls values for attributes. 

Scalability and Performance:
The system should be scalable to handle a large number of artworks.
It must ensure efficient data retrieval and minimize latency for API requests.

Security and Access :
Implement security best practises whereever applicable. Secrets must be read as environment variables instead of maintaining them in version control. 
Systems website UI must be accessible to any user.

Documentation and Usage Guidelines:
Javadoc comments can be provided as part of the source code 
System website UI must be intuitive and easy to use. 

Error Handling and Logging:
Handle errors gracefully, providing informative error messages.
Implement logging for debugging purposes

Testing and Quality Assurance:
Develop unit tests to verify the correctness of data retrieval and attribute handling.
Write integration tests for end to end verification and automate tests them whereever applicable.

Performance Metrics and Monitoring:
Set up performance metrics to monitor API metrics (counters), response times, and resource utilization. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for observability
